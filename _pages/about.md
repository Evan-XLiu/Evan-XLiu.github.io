Hi! I am Xuanwei Liu (刘轩伟), an Undergraduate student in Automation at the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen [(HITSZ)](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/). I am currently advised by Prof. [Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io/) at the NUS LinS Lab and Prof. [Yongquan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1t1iV1AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at [AIRS](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/en). Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Piecewise Affine Learning & Control Lab](https://pwalclab.com/public/index.php?title=Main_Page), advised by Prof. [Jun Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=bsD6IowAAAAJ). In Fall 2026, I will join National University of Singapore [(NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/) as an incoming M.Sc. student in Robotics.
